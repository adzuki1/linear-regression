## Linear Regression Modeling with Synthetic Data

Description

This Python project implements a simple linear regression model using fake data generated with NumPy. The script generates random data, fits a linear regression model using the normal equation, and visualizes the original data points along with the regression line using Matplotlib.


Overview

This project serves as a foundational example for understanding linear regression modeling. It generates synthetic data, trains a linear regression model, and visualizes the results using Matplotlib. The code is modularized for better organization and readability.
